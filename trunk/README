OpenVisualizer v0.0000001



For an overview of the code structure, look in doc/OVERVIEW



Directory structure:

doc/		Documentation
base/		basic functionality used in all other components
main/		main application code
math/		math codebase
ogl/		OpenGL code & renderer
video/		codebase for graphics processing
bksys/		The build tool
build/		Will be created by bksys; contains the shared objects & the executables

Needed libraries in linux:
GL
m
dl
qt

BKSys is used here. If you don't have scons 0.96.91 or newer, unpack the scons-mini tar.bz2 in
bksys/, then execute bksys/scons in the root directory. You have to call scons twice
(configuration and actual building).

Each subdirectory has its own SConscript.

Code in base/, math/, ogl/ and video/ originated from the Ion Engine codebase,
which is LGPL-licensed. For more info, contact Carlos Rafael Giani (dv@dword.org).

To check out via ssh, use:

svn checkout svn+ssh://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/ovis/trunk ovis

Don't forget the "ovis" parameter at the end of the line, or else svn
will checkout into a directory called "trunk" and not "ovis".
