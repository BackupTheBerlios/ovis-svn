OpenVisualizer v0.0000001



For an overview of the code structure, look in doc/OVERVIEW



Directory structure:

doc/		Documentation
base/		basic functionality used in all other components
main/		main application code
math/		math codebase
ogl/		OpenGL code & renderer
video/		codebase for graphics processing

Needed libraries in linux:
GL
m
dl

There are two build profiles: release and debug.
The project is built in the root directory using
"scons profile=<profilename>". So, for building the project in debug
mode, use "scons profile=debug". If no profile=<profilename> parameter
is given (e.g. simply "scons" is entered) the project defaults to
the release profile.

Each subdirectory has its own SConscript. Compilation results are stored
in <subdirname>_<profilename>. So, if the project is built in debug mode,
then the compilation results of "base" are stored in base/base_debug.
The same applies to all directories. svn ignore properties are set so
that these directories are ignored. Please note that the linker results
are stored in the root directory. The result of a debug build are
several .so's and one "ovis_d" file in the root directory. svn ignore
properties are set so that these are ignored too. In the "main" directory,
moc_*.cc files are also ignored.

Code in base/, math/, ogl/ and video/ originated from the Ion Engine codebase,
which is LGPL-licensed. For more info, contact Carlos Rafael Giani (dv@dword.org).

To check out via ssh, use:

svn checkout svn+ssh://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/ovis/trunk ovis

Don't forget the "ovis" parameter at the end of the line, or else svn
will checkout into a directory called "trunk" and not "ovis".
