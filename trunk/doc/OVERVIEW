The video::Renderer class is the base of the graphics in OpenVisualizer.
It traverses a scenegraph and renders the result of the visits.
video::Renderer is an abstract class, and the derivatives can be loaded
dynamically as plugins.

So far, one derivative exists: oglrenderer in ogl/

To show an object, one needs a video::Scenenode derivative which contains
the object's data. This scenenode first allocates memory for vertices and
indices using Renderer::createVertexstream() and Renderer::createIndexstream().
Both streams are filled with data by first calling their map() methods, then
transferring data using the set methods (for example, position(0,4.4f,1,1) to
write coords 4.4,1,1 of vertex #0), then unmap(). map and unmap are necessary
to ensure that the accessed memory is valid.

After this, when the node gets visited, the renderer calls onVisit(), the
parameter is a VisitContext instance, where the node can enter some Visit
instances into the visitorqueue containing some rendering data.

Usually, an application just has to create a renderer instance, create one
or more nodes, connect them to form a graph, and call the renderScene()
method of the renderer and giving a camera and one of the graph nodes as
parameters.

Some renderers require extra attention:
The OGLRenderer stores the parameters supplied in init(), but does not
actually initialize anything. It is expected that OpenGL is initialized
*before* creating an OGLRenderer instance. This behavior is necessary
for OGLRenderer's usage with Qt's QGLWidget class.
Other, non-hardware accelerated renderers yet to be written may require
access to a framebuffer.




The base::String class exists for DLL purposes only. Sometimes, std::string
causes problems crossing DLLs. base::String wraps around std::string.
base::Stringlist is just an array of base::String objects.
base::Streamable exists for similar reasons.
